# Schematic Design of Negative edge D-Flip-Flop

## Components Required -

- 1 Clk
- 1 Clk_bar
- 2 Latches

## Circuit Connections -

- Drag the Clk, Clk_bar and Latches to the workspace
- Connect the top node of both latch 1 and latch 2 to Clk and Clk_bar respctively
- Connect the input terminal to left node of Latch 1 and right node of Latch 1 is subsequently connected to Latch 2
- Connect the output terminal to the right node of Latch 2

## Observations -

- On clicking "validate" option after completing the circuit (assuming all connections are done correctly) you should see a graph under the observations tab
- Observe the fluctuations occurring
- By default, the input has been set to 1 and the corresponding output observed is 0. To check otherwise, double-click the input.
