      "explanations": {
        "a": "Correct. D in D flip-flop stands for 'Data'.",
        "b": "Incorrect. D does not stand for 'Delay' in D flip-flop.",
        "c": "Incorrect. D stands only for 'Data', not both data and delay.",

      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. S=D_bar, R=D does not produce the required D flip-flop behavior.",
        "b": "Correct. S=D, R=D_bar configures the SR flip-flop to behave as a D flip-flop.",
        "c": "Incorrect. S=0, R=D_bar keeps the flip-flop in reset regardless of D.",

      "answers": {
        "a": "1",
        "b": "0",
        "c": "Previous value",
        "d": "Z"
      },
      "correctAnswer": "c",
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. The output does not change to 1 at the negative edge; it retains its previous value.",
        "b": "Incorrect. The output does not change to 0 at the negative edge; it retains its previous value.",
        "c": "Correct. At the negative edge, the output remains at its previous value.",

        "a": "Correct. In a D flip-flop, Q_plus equals the input D.",
